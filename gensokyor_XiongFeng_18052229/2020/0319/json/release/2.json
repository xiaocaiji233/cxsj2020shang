Improvements mostly due\n  to moving to 32-bit indices, faster shuffling kernels.  More improvements to\n  come in later releases.\n\n### Bug fixes\n- Lots of fixes to documentation and tutorials, many contributed\n  by the public.\n- 271 closed issues\n\n### Backwards-incompatible changes\n- `tf.nn.fixed_unigram_candidate_sampler` changed its default `distortion`\n  attribute from 0.0 to 1.0. This was a bug in the original release\n  that is now fixed.\n"}]
