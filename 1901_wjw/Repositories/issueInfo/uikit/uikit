To quote:\r\n\r\n> Browser (Chrome) ask the server using a regular <img> or <script> tag. If the server is in the same domain it does not includes an CORS headers.\r\n> Server (S3) returns the resource. If no Origin header was present in the request it does not attach CORS headers in the reply as they are redundant.\r\n> Browser (Chrome) try and get the resource again using AJAX, but this time doesn't really go to the server but looks at the cached resource.\r\n> Browser (Chrome) The cached version does not have CORS headers. It will drop the request as Access-Control-Allow-Origin violation or other related problems.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\nhttps://codepen.io/ilikerobots/pen/LYVLVWx\r\n\r\nNote the animation will not work if the page is loaded with cache enabled.  If cache is disabled (e.g. via dev tools) the animation will work since the requests are not cached with missing CORS info.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nAs noted by drdek's answer in the SO link above, a workaround is to add `crossorigin='use-credentials'` to the image link, forcing chrome to send CORS credentials initially.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4139","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4139/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4139/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4139/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/4139","id":571738320,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NzE3MzgzMjA=","number":4139,"title":"W3C CSS + JS validation errors during minification","user":{"login":"sylvaincaillot","id":4845910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDU5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4845910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot","html_url":"https://github.com/sylvaincaillot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvaincaillot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48863778,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODg2Mzc3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/labels/!%20Bug","name":"!

What problem does it solve?*\r\nWhen I tell someone to read or to download UIkit, 90% of them read or download the wrong version. And seriously, I have enough. So here my suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. Please remove your lost and transparent button **Download** at top right that nobody sees and add a highlighted button **Download v3.3.3** next to your button **Get started** and **Github**, ideally at the first position.\r\n2. This new button \"Download v[current version]\" should be more visible than the UIkit 2 button. Actually, they have the same appearance ! That's confusing.\r\n3. Please add a banner or a warning on all the pages on https://getuikit.com/v2/, for your readers, to tell them that they are reading an old documentation and that a more recent version does exist. For example \"You are reading the documentation about UIkit 2. Click here to read the documentation about UIkit 3.\".\r\n4. Please mention the version of UIkit in the main content of your homepage https://getuikit.com/. You don't even mention the word \"UIkit\" ! The only word \"UIkit\" we can find on this page is \"Uikit 2\" which redirects people to an old version !\r\n\r\n I'm even not a copywriter. It's just common sense.\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\n*On a scale of 1-5, how important is this feature to you?

What problem does it solve?*\r\nI'm developing a **_chrome extension_** using your **_uikit_** and **_vue_**. \r\nWhen I try to use the notification component I have an content_security_policy notification error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRefused to execute inline event handler because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'\". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-...'), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.\r\n```\r\n\r\n[chrome contentSecurityPolicy](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy\r\n)\r\nmy manifest contains the next line: \r\n\r\n```nodejs  \r\n\"content_security_policy\": \"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was looking for a solution but and the end I think that the problem is you can not use the **_eval_** functions or something similar in the code for avoid some injection attack and so on. I think the notification lib is using the **_setInterval_** or **_setTimeout_** function which can be the problem because is using the **_eval_** feature. \r\n\r\n```nodejs\r\nUIkit.notification({\r\n    message: 'my-message!',\r\n    status: 'primary',\r\n    pos: 'top-right',\r\n    timeout: 5000\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs workaround, maybe adding some keywords in the **_content_security_policy_** could help, but I did not which ones or how to do it. \r\n\r\n[chrome contentSecurityPolicy](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy\r\n)\r\n**_Eval and related functions are disabled_**\r\nCode like the following does not work:\r\n```nodejs\r\nalert(eval(\"foo.bar.baz\"));\r\nwindow.setTimeout(\"alert('hi')\", 10);\r\nwindow.setInterval(\"alert('hi')\", 10);\r\nnew Function(\"return foo.bar.baz\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\n*On a scale of 1-5, how important is this feature to you? Please explain.*\r\nFor me it's a 5, I think that if I can not use the notifications in the chrome extension I'm a little bit limited... \r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4105","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4105/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4105/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4105/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/4105","id":561526162,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NjE1MjYxNjI=","number":4105,"title":"Position center on Safari","user":{"login":"gregBerthelot","id":19594443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTk0NDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19594443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot","html_url":"https://github.com/gregBerthelot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregBerthelot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48863778,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODg2Mzc3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/labels/!%20Bug","name":"!

It works great except when using it in IE 11 with left floated elements with match all (row: false).\r\n\r\nSince UIKit doesn't set the height of the base element (the one it's setting the height of all other elements to equal) IE 11 considers it to be (taller?) or something and causes the wrapped elements to be pushed across. Is there a way around this?\r\n \r\nWould a pull request to have the base item also have its height set work or is the premise that UIKit would like to be able to handle the base element changing height and causing all the other element's heights too?

What problem does it solve?*\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest a new option \"attr\" to \"uk-toggle\". Current version can toggle a class name on an element when `cls` option is specified. When omitted, it toggles an attribute `hidden`. I think 'attr' option would be useful if one wants to manipulate attribute names other than `hidden` over class names.\r\n\r\nI think toggling a `disabled` attribute to a `fieldset` element could be one of useful cases. A series of `input` elements in a hidden `fieldset` is still subject to submitting. So toggling `disabled` attribute instead of `hidden` can solve this case by adding `attr=\"disabled\"` to `uk-toggle`. Like below,\r\n\r\n`<button uk-toggle=\"#invoice\" attr=\"disabled\">disable/enable the invoice field set</button>`\r\n\r\nIf `attr` is used in conjunction with `cls`, my understanding is that a target would receive toggling effects for both attribute name and class. Also, `hidden` as a default option of `attr` would not cause a break change of `uk-toggle` usage.\r\n\r\nIf someone has thought about this, please share your feedback.\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\n*On a scale of 1-5, how important is this feature to you? Please explain.*\r\n\r\n1, because I don't think this would take higher priority over committing bug fix codes. I have no idea how difficult to give a new option to a uk component when it comes to `uk-toggle`."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4053","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4053/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4053/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4053/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/4053","id":531901447,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MzE5MDE0NDc=","number":4053,"title":"Modal and offcanvas set overflow-x instead of overflow: visible; after closing","user":{"login":"puurinternet","id":12542338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyMzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12542338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet","html_url":"https://github.com/puurinternet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puurinternet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2019-12-03T10:59:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T17:50:26Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nWe are working on a website where both uikit and [fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js) are being used.\r\n\r\nBy default the body element has an overflow visible, so you can scroll from one \"slide\" to the next one of the onepage scroller. But if you close a modal or an offpage (used for the hamburger menu) it sets only overflow-x to visible instead of overflow.\r\n\r\nOn desktop this means we get a scrollbar, which makes the width slightly smaller and that causes the page to not exactly scroll to the right point. I kind of fixed this with a not very elegant javascript:\r\n` \r\n       $('#modal-media-youtube').on({\r\n\r\n        'hidden.uk.modal':function(event){\r\n\r\n            setTimeout(function() { window.document.body.style.overflowY = 'hidden'; }, 200);\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    });â€‹`\r\n\r\nBut on mobile this is more annoying, because no overflow-y means you can't scroll anymore at all after closing the offcanvas navigation.\r\n\r\nSo could you maybe look into setting the overflow setting back to the original setting, instead of just setting overflow-x?\r\n\r\nThanks, Rogier.\r\n\r\nPs.

(similar to `uk-offcanvas=\"overlay: false\"`)\r\nI was trying to create a draggable modal with UIkit like in this [Bootstrap example](https://codepen.io/adamcjoiner/pen/PNbbbv) and realized there is no option for the Modal component to disable its overlay, so the [result ends up like this](https://codepen.io/m-ahmadi/pen/oNgvYGe).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\n*On a scale of 1-5, how important is this feature to you? Please explain.*\r\n\r\nI would say 4.\r\nWell, one popular use case would be creating draggable config panels, sorta similar to setting panels in Photoshop (except being dockable) or config panels in the [TadingView chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/djyy0KVg/).\r\n\r\nThe reason I say 4 is that, if you are using UIkit, and you want to implement these panels for example, then you have to use another library for the Modal (or think of it some other way), but by having this simple option, you can totally implement them with UIkit itself."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4048","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4048/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4048/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4048/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/4048","id":528000617,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MjgwMDA2MTc=","number":4048,"title":"Design System - Sketch File","user":{"login":"Factored-Dan","id":16665912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjY1OTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16665912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan","html_url":"https://github.com/Factored-Dan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Factored-Dan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48863803,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODg2MzgwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/labels/!%20Feature","name":"!
