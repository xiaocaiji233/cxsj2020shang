That is, there's a reference stored on the DOM node, as part of a private property called `__uikit__`. You _could_ grab it there, but I'd rather see a helper like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$('#offcanvas').uikit('offcanvas', options); // initialize or update - returns component instance\r\n...\r\nvar component = $('#offcanvas').uikit('offcanvas'); // grab the component for use\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo unless the provided example `UIkit.offcanvas('#offcanvas').toggle();` works as the code above, I think such a function would be in order. For example, it's not clear if it will re-initialize or re-configure if needed, forcing an update if already attached.\r\n\r\nThat said, there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes with UIkit, that is fully undocumented to us. From the looks of it, it appears like an advanced UI framework, which mimics vue.js and similar projects. There's directives, attributes, local state and even automatic mounting using DOM events.\r\n\r\nIt's very hard to follow the flow and lifecycle events a UIkit component goes through, so any documentation on this would be very welcome.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it would be interesting to see a simple 'hello world' component example. Not only to learn more about the current components, but perhaps also to develop custom components using these concepts.\r\n"}},{"id":3122522265,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzEyMjUyMjI2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/events/3122522265","actor":{"login":"janschoenherr","id":355427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTQyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/355427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr","html_url":"https://github.com/janschoenherr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janschoenherr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-12T11:55:26Z","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4144","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4144/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4144/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/4144/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/4144","id":576797023,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NzY3OTcwMjM=","number":4144,"title":"Sortable performance","user":{"login":"Lumelomser","id":30808076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODA4MDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30808076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser","html_url":"https://github.com/Lumelomser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumelomser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48863778,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODg2Mzc3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/labels/!%20Bug","name":"!
