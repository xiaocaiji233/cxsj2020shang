To quote:\r\n\r\n> Browser (Chrome) ask the server using a regular <img> or <script> tag. If the server is in the same domain it does not includes an CORS headers.\r\n> Server (S3) returns the resource. If no Origin header was present in the request it does not attach CORS headers in the reply as they are redundant.\r\n> Browser (Chrome) try and get the resource again using AJAX, but this time doesn't really go to the server but looks at the cached resource.\r\n> Browser (Chrome) The cached version does not have CORS headers.

Please remove your lost and transparent button **Download** at top right that nobody sees and add a highlighted button **Download v3.3.3** next to your button **Get started** and **Github**, ideally at the first position.\r\n2. This new button \"Download v[current version]\" should be more visible than the UIkit 2 button. Actually, they have the same appearance ! That's confusing.\r\n3. Please add a banner or a warning on all the pages on https://getuikit.com/v2/, for your readers, to tell them that they are reading an old documentation and that a more recent version does exist. For example \"You are reading the documentation about UIkit 2. Click here to read the documentation about UIkit 3.\".\r\n4. Please mention the version of UIkit in the main content of your homepage https://getuikit.com/. You don't even mention the word \"UIkit\" ! The only word \"UIkit\" we can find on this page is \"Uikit 2\" which redirects people to an old version !\r\n\r\n I'm even not a copywriter.

What problem does it solve?*\r\nI'm developing a **_chrome extension_** using your **_uikit_** and **_vue_**. \r\nWhen I try to use the notification component I have an content_security_policy notification error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRefused to execute inline event handler because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'\". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-...'), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.\r\n```\r\n\r\n[chrome contentSecurityPolicy](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy\r\n)\r\nmy manifest contains the next line: \r\n\r\n```nodejs  \r\n\"content_security_policy\": \"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was looking for a solution but and the end I think that the problem is you can not use the **_eval_** functions or something similar in the code for avoid some injection attack and so on. I think the notification lib is using the **_setInterval_** or **_setTimeout_** function which can be the problem because is using the **_eval_** feature. \r\n\r\n```nodejs\r\nUIkit.notification({\r\n    message: 'my-message!',\r\n    status: 'primary',\r\n    pos: 'top-right',\r\n    timeout: 5000\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs workaround, maybe adding some keywords in the **_content_security_policy_** could help, but I did not which ones or how to do it. \r\n\r\n[chrome contentSecurityPolicy](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy\r\n)\r\n**_Eval and related functions are disabled_**\r\nCode like the following does not work:\r\n```nodejs\r\nalert(eval(\"foo.bar.baz\"));\r\nwindow.setTimeout(\"alert('hi')\", 10);\r\nwindow.setInterval(\"alert('hi')\", 10);\r\nnew Function(\"return foo.bar.baz\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\n*On a scale of 1-5, how important is this feature to you?

It works great except when using it in IE 11 with left floated elements with match all (row: false).\r\n\r\nSince UIKit doesn't set the height of the base element (the one it's setting the height of all other elements to equal) IE 11 considers it to be (taller?) or something and causes the wrapped elements to be pushed across. Is there a way around this?\r\n \r\nWould a pull request to have the base item also have its height set work or is the premise that UIKit would like to be able to handle the base element changing height and causing all the other element's heights too? Maybe an option?\r\nhere's a diagram of what I mean\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33679961/72028421-90af0200-32d6-11ea-9002-f96d85c1182a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nUIKit does **not** set the height of the blue card since it's the tallest card in the set.

What problem does it solve?*\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest a new option \"attr\" to \"uk-toggle\". Current version can toggle a class name on an element when `cls` option is specified. When omitted, it toggles an attribute `hidden`. I think 'attr' option would be useful if one wants to manipulate attribute names other than `hidden` over class names.\r\n\r\nI think toggling a `disabled` attribute to a `fieldset` element could be one of useful cases. A series of `input` elements in a hidden `fieldset` is still subject to submitting. So toggling `disabled` attribute instead of `hidden` can solve this case by adding `attr=\"disabled\"` to `uk-toggle`. Like below,\r\n\r\n`<button uk-toggle=\"#invoice\" attr=\"disabled\">disable/enable the invoice field set</button>`\r\n\r\nIf `attr` is used in conjunction with `cls`, my understanding is that a target would receive toggling effects for both attribute name and class. Also, `hidden` as a default option of `attr` would not cause a break change of `uk-toggle` usage.\r\n\r\nIf someone has thought about this, please share your feedback.\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\n*On a scale of 1-5, how important is this feature to you? Please explain.*\r\n\r\n1, because I don't think this would take higher priority over committing bug fix codes.

But if you close a modal or an offpage (used for the hamburger menu) it sets only overflow-x to visible instead of overflow.\r\n\r\nOn desktop this means we get a scrollbar, which makes the width slightly smaller and that causes the page to not exactly scroll to the right point.

This is really frustrating and a waste of time.\r\n\r\nYou will tell me: Just change the color `$subnav-item-color`, `$subnav-item-hover-color`, etc!\r\nI will tell you: No, because we can use `.uk-subnav` in different parts of website, where the links and content have different colors or backgrounds. So an unique color defined in SASS/LESS is totally absurd.\r\n\r\nIf I set the color 'red' for the links in my header and if I also use `.uk-subnav` for my main menu, I do not want an other color for the links in my `.uk-subnav`.

attribute on a tag like `a` to put images in the background based on the `data-src` or `data-srcset` attributes. If you put more than one image format in the data-srcset, UIKit will always pick the first one.\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\nIf I were to put the same `srcset `attribute on an `img `tag, I would expect the browser to pick the format it prefers automatically.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nUIKit doesn't reimplement the format choosing behaviour, so it picks the first one in the list.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a deliberate choice to not reimplement all the browser preferences.

I would like to make a feature request:\r\n\r\n**Request**\r\nCurrently, the active state for a link on `navbar`, `nav` and `dropdown` can only be set by placing `.uk-active`on the `li` element. However, I would like to request if we could give the user the flexibility to have the same behaviour by placing the `uk-active` class to the `a` element.\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\nI'm facing an issue where it is impossible to place the `.uk-active` on the `li` element in a part of my application without breaking the dropdown behaviour of the dropdown menu for the navbar.\r\n\r\nI'm using Svelte and I'm trying to create a component that encapsulates the behaviour of detecting route change and adding the `uk-active` class to the `li` element but I wasn't able successfully to do that without sacrificing menu dropdowns. Hence I resorted to adding the `uk-active` class to the `a` element and then styling it consistently to the active links in my custom stylesheet, but I feel that it would be beneficial to add it to uikit framework to give the users the flexibility to style an active link either by adding `uk-active` to either of the `a` or `li` elements for similar cases.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Solution**\r\nWe could make the similar ammendments wherever applicable across the `dropdown.less`, `nav.less` and `navbar.less` files:\r\n```\r\n// From this\r\n.uk-navbar-nav > li.uk-active > a {\r\n    color: @navbar-nav-item-active-color;\r\n    .hook-navbar-nav-item-active;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// to this\r\n.uk-navbar-nav > li.uk-active > a,\r\n.uk-navbar-nav > li > a.uk-active {\r\n    color: @navbar-nav-item-active-color;\r\n    .hook-navbar-nav-item-active;\r\n}\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3977","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3977/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3977/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3977/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/3977","id":493506463,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTM1MDY0NjM=","number":3977,"title":"Modal form goes up when form input in focus","user":{"login":"kos0760","id":25278076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mjc4MDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25278076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760","html_url":"https://github.com/kos0760","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kos0760/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-09-13T20:35:08Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T21:29:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I place the form in a modal window.

took these screenshots so sharing them in case it helps anyone else in creating svg icons.\r\n\r\ni don't use illustrator much so it was kind of painful figuring this out, and there might be better ways of doing it, but it seemed to produce desired results.  \r\n\r\nword to the wise - during this process i discovered that making good icon designs is a lot harder than i thought it would be, so be mindful about how much time you devote to the process - making a 'project' icon can easily consume half a day and result in nothing usable from a design perspective :).    \r\n\r\nthe default size of the icons included in uikit seems to be 20 x 20.\r\n\r\nan example of their svg code in `uikit/src/images/icons/check.svg` is:\r\n```svg  \r\n<svg width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\r\n    <polyline fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#000\" stroke-width=\"1.1\" points=\"4,10 8,15 17,4\" />\r\n</svg>\r\n```\r\nso my goal was to generate svg code that kind of looked like that.  \r\n\r\n---   \r\n\r\n**step 01:**  \r\n\r\ncreate an illustrator file with some background screenies of your interface, a yellow colored 20 x 20pt 'icon container' layer, and your icon objects.  \r\n\r\n![making_a_svg_step_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5090307/60392036-e98b2a00-9b3e-11e9-9571-5852ba08e28f.png)\r\n\r\n---   \r\n\r\n**step 02:**\r\n\r\nselect the yellow 'icon container' layer, hide all layers except it and your icon objects, and go to:\r\n\r\n`Object` > `Artboards` > `Fit to Selected Art`\r\n\r\nthis will shrink your artboard to the size of your 'icon container' layer.\r\n\r\n***important:  make sure you \"undo\" this step after you have exported your svg file so that you retain your original artboard dimensions - the \"undo\" history is not limitless in illustrator, so if you make lots of changes after shrinking your artboard, you might not be able to \"undo\" back to the point in time when your artboard was larger***\r\n\r\n![making_a_svg_step_02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5090307/60392085-b1381b80-9b3f-11e9-8cc3-824b2056a3b2.png)\r\n\r\n---   \r\n\r\n**step 03:**\r\n\r\nhide the yellow 'icon container' layer so you still have a 20 x 20 artboard and go to:\r\n\r\n`File` > `Export` > `Export for Screens`\r\n\r\n![making_a_svg_step_03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5090307/60392124-6ec30e80-9b40-11e9-8a95-52c6225221ae.png)\r\n\r\n---   \r\n\r\n**step 04:**\r\n\r\nmake sure `Artboards` is selected so you export the full 20 x 20 area.  \r\n\r\nselect `svg` as the format, and then click the settings icon.  \r\n\r\n![making_a_svg_step_04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5090307/60392153-d2e5d280-9b40-11e9-9c27-61dfa33e0a96.png)\r\n\r\n---   \r\n\r\n**step 05:**\r\n\r\nthese settings seemed to produce the code that most closely resembled the default uikit icon's code.

  \r\n\r\n**step 08:**\r\n\r\nopen the svg file in your editor and it should look pretty much like the default uikit icon code, the only extra bit being a `<title>` tag, which can be removed.  \r\n\r\n![making_a_svg_step_08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5090307/60392204-6b7c5280-9b41-11e9-8e92-e43bd9537afd.png)\r\n\r\n---   \r\n\r\n**step 09:**\r\n\r\nto preserve any colors in

UIkit version\r\n3.0.0-rc.22\r\n\r\n### Browser\r\nAll\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nI'm aware that new icons can be added to uikit's library, but it requires compiling uikit and using that custom compilation. In our case, we use the CDN for UIKit to build a custom theme for each Drupal site we build. It would be nice if UIKit had a way to handle custom icons by simply adding svg elements inline.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n\r\nWhat currently happens:\r\nhttps://codepen.io/andy-blum/pen/XyRQZo\r\n\r\nWhat it would be nice to see:\r\nhttps://codepen.io/andy-blum/pen/RqVmpL\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nPlace custom inline svg inside a parent with the uk-icon attribute\r\n`<span uk-icon><svg></svg></span>`\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\nI would expect that the uk-icon attribute & component options would influence the sizing of the svg code inside.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, since the bundled icons get a default width/height of 20x20 px, I would anticipate the custom svg element to be scaled to those dimensions and for the ratio component to accurately resize the icon.\r\n\r\nPerhaps telling UIkit to handle icons this way using:\r\n`<span uk-icon=\"icon:custom;ratio:X;><svg></svg></span>`\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe svg element is only influenced by the uk-icon class on its parent element and the relevant

\".show_it\", function(e) {\r\n  UIkit.dropdown(\".my_dropdown\").show();\r\n}); \r\n```\r\n**Hide**\r\n```js\r\n$(document).on(\"click\", \".hide_it\", function(e) {\r\n

So instead I'll do a feature request. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could get the sticky to calculate from the bottom of the viewport rather than the top.\r\n\r\nThis would be a great thing when you want something to stick to the bottom when scroll down. We have an example where you scroll through some text then it sticks to the bottom and follows you down through a section. Sticky would not work in this instance is you will not be able to read all the text before it follows you. Allowing things to stick to the bottom would be a great feature. Again, something I would be happy to implement, but it would only be ignored and wasted time.

Yes, for experts and professionals it is very easy to combine and change the styling of each component, but without official examples, beginners will be very difficult to combine and styling for each component. I know many way to combine and use all feature, but if have **Example Page** to every component used, is very big improve.\r\n\r\nMy request is, beside pro, documentation or changelog menu. Will be amazing if have a example menu. Like blog page who use : navigation, offcanvas, card, comment component\r\nLike landing page who use : navigation, offcanvas, slider, video, paralax component\r\nLike dashboard page who usel : navigation, table list, edit form\r\netc\r\n\r\nThis is very usefull for beginners, after read documentation for some component (now documentation and examples code per component is very good) and he want to combine each component to implement in some page, he confused how to styling component to show what he wants. I knowm Maybe for implementation many way to do this, every people, every person have a way to use this framework, but if beginners see the best practice to use/custom/implement this component

Lightbox). This has a great disadvantage on small screens:\r\n\r\nIf the user hovers over a next/previous button (e. g. in an open Lightbox), the browser shows up the address on the left bottom corner. In the example with the lightbox this hides the caption and is no longer visible. Besides that, it is very anoying that the address (which is not a real address) will be displayed at all:\r\n\r\n![anchorproblem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12196222/41176321-40f234d8-6b60-11e8-898f-11732cdb512d.jpg)\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to use a data attribute instead of href attribute (e. g. data-src), so we can use any other element instead an anchor (e. g. span, div etc).

I also had to go through and add !default in many places.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Seems to work if....\r\nIf you build from source using your build scripts right from src UIKit seesm very customizable, however using a system like webpack and pulling from npm into a node_modules folder it seems very complex. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Icons\r\nFor example, adding in custom icons, in the docs you say you have to put the icons in the custom/** folder, however we shouldn't be modifying the node_modules/uikit folder, especially checking that into source control. So, i had to completely create a custom build script to look elsewhere.\r\n\r\n# My new base.scss for order of scss operations\r\n\r\n```\r\n// 1. Local Global Variable Overrides (does not require !default suffix)\r\n@import \"pinewood/global-variables.scss\";\r\n\r\n// 2. Global Variables (which all had to be suffixed with !default - this is a copy of uikit/src/scss/components/variables.scss, pulled local so i can make modifications for my clients project instead of modifying the very ugly variables.scss)\r\n@import \"uikit/base/global-variables.scss\";\r\n\r\n// 3. Base Variables (these are all the component's base variables suffixed with !default - it is uikit/src/scss/components/_import.scss without the \"variables.scss\" import)\r\n@import \"Client/uikit/base/_import-variables.scss\";\r\n\r\n// 4. Theme Variables (any custom variables I have for my theme that don't deal with uikit at all)\r\n@import \"pinewood/_import-variables.scss\";\r\n\r\n// 5. Global Mixins\r\n@import \"Client/uikit/base/global-mixins.scss\";\r\n\r\n// 6. Base Mixins\r\n@import \"Client/uikit/base/_import-mixins.scss\";\r\n\r\n// 7. Theme Mixins\r\n\r\n// 8. Local Mixin Overrides\r\n\r\n// 9. Import UIkit components (relevant to my clients site)\r\n@import \"Client/uikit/components.scss\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe order is different for scss and mixins since with classes is it first in wins where mixins last in wins, and since your src has these in the same file it is hard to do custom changes to both without using the very ugly variables.scss.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents and would really like to see some examples on how to do custom scss, custom mixins, and custom icons using the npm package and webpack. Your webpack example is very basic, you are even calling the dist/css from the node_modules folder. I have tried a couple times to get this to work but I always find myself having to pull the scss out of the node_modules directory through some process or manually to make it work for customization.  I do realize I can just create a global \"overrides\" like the processed variables.scss file you have but it just seems very complex to work with.\r\n\r\nIt just seems like there has to be an easier way when using webpack.\r\n\r\nCurrently it seems like you would have to:\r\n\r\n- Add custom icons to a folder in src\r\n- install uikit from npm\r\n- Copy the icon files and any custom scss/css from there to the node_modules/uikit/custom\r\n- Run the entire UIKit build processes where the working directory is node_modules/uikit\r\n- Reference the dist folder in webpack\r\n\r\nBut hoping there is a better way\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3411","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3411/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3411/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3411/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/3411","id":328506453,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjg1MDY0NTM=","number":3411,"title":"Feature Request: Responsive uk-grid gutter (i.e. uk-grid-medium / large)","user":{"login":"paul-muckypuddle","id":9194004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxOTQwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9194004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-muckypuddle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-muckypuddle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-06-01T12:46:13Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T13:33:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"It'd be really handy to have the uk-grid-collapse / small / medium / large classes work responsively like grid width.

This is great for use with the Cover and with the **Slideshow** component too, sometimes important part of the image it´s cropped. \r\nThink a CMS where the client can set the slideshow image alignment dinamically.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is already possible to do, i didn´t find how to do it.\r\nThanks for your work!\r\n\r\n![cover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5558563/35980048-8905303c-0cc8-11e8-962c-b76e0e318d94.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3212","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3212/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3212/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3212/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/3212","id":295222592,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTUyMjI1OTI=","number":3212,"title":"More space between buttons in dialogs","user":{"login":"ikabod","id":12196222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk2MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12196222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod","html_url":"https://github.com/ikabod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikabod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-02-07T17:19:49Z","updated_at":"2018-02-07T17:19:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nGot a question?\r\n===============\r\nThe issue list of this repo is exclusively for bug reports and feature requests.

Not tested on PC.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n\r\nIssue appears on UIKIt documentation pages:\r\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/position\r\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/overlay\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nView pages above on the iOS browsers mentioned. Look at the bottom of colored overlays with uk-position-bottom-* and uk-position-cover.\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the image and the overlay should be in the same position.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n\r\nA 1px-high line of the image is exposed below the overlay.\r\n\r\n### Further information\r\n\r\nThe issue does not seem to occur with the overlay over a div with fixed height, only when over an image. Applying a CSS fixed height to the img element removes the issue (using the height attribute doesn't seem to work), but obviously this causes distortion with responsive images and isn't a solution. It seems that the cause of the problem may be a rounding issue with images.\r\n\r\nA kludgy workaround, if the color of the overlay matches the main page background, is to apply margin-bottom:-1 to the overlay. If the colors do not match, a 1px line of overlay with no image behind is visible - though may be less noticeable than a line of exposed image.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3020","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3020/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3020/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3020/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/3020","id":273415428,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzM0MTU0Mjg=","number":3020,"title":"Dropdown content color: section inverse vs default inverse","user":{"login":"IamSAB","id":8931240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MzEyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8931240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB","html_url":"https://github.com/IamSAB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IamSAB/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48863864,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODg2Mzg2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/labels/CSS","name":"CSS","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-11-13T12:39:55Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T13:31:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"If I create a nav (in my case a subnav) inside a section with light style (primary or secondary) the links of the dropdown nav are in white (or light mode) color, so not readable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I use the `uk-preserve-color` class for mentioned sections styles in combination with the `uk-light` class, the dropdown links are in grey (or dark mode) color, so readable.\r\n\r\nIs the inverse component intended to work this way or misses the section inverse feature a rule for applying the correct style?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3019","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3019/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3019/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/3019/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/3019","id":273369668,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzMzNjk2Njg=","number":3019,"title":"V3 notifications background","user":{"login":"robertotremonti","id":2034230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzQyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2034230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti","html_url":"https://github.com/robertotremonti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertotremonti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48863803,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODg2MzgwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/labels/!%20Feature","name":"!

Follow the instructions on the migration page (https://getuikit.com/docs/migration) to insert the javascript snippet (under the HTML Integration heading) into your HTML.\r\n`<script src=\"https://getuikit.com/migrate.min.js\"></script>`\r\n\r\n2. Insert the navbar template code found on the navbar page (https://getuikit.com/docs/navbar). You can use the very first code markup sample on that page (or create your own navbar snippet based on that markup). Example:\r\n```html\r\n<nav class=\"uk-navbar-container\" uk-navbar>\r\n    <div class=\"uk-navbar-left\">\r\n        <ul class=\"uk-navbar-nav\">\r\n            <li><a href=\"\">One</a></li>\r\n            <li><a href=\"\">Two</a></li>\r\n            <li><a href=\"\">Three</a></li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n</nav>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run the code, and observe that the migration helper will issue a warning saying \"**The content of the navbar needs to be wrapped into a container containing the float.**\" But the navbar **is already** wrapped into such a container!\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\nMigration helper should not issue a warning since the navbar already wrapped into one of the recommended containers (uk-navbar-left | uk-navbar-center | uk-navbar-right).\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nMigration helper issues a warning despite the recommended code structure is correct - at least according to the documentation.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2864","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2864/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2864/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2864/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2864","id":253883436,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNTM4ODM0MzY=","number":2864,"title":"nestable

Then there are grid classes `uk-grid-small`, `uk-grid-medium` and `uk-grid-large`. `uk-grid-small` and `uk-grid-large` set the distance between grid cells equal to `global-gutter-small` and `global-gutter-large` respectively. So far seems natural. But then if you use `uk-grid-medium` it sets the space between the cells equal to `global-gutter`, not `global-gutter-medium` even though it also has word \"medium\". On the other hand if you put neither of these classes the space is set to `global-gutter-medium` and not just `global-gutter`. So it seems like these two values(medium and unspecified) are effectively \"swaped\". You get the medium gutter if don't specify it and you get the unspecified one if you specify it to be medium.

I've used things `.uk-badge-level-1` - `.uk-badge-level-5`, `.uk-badge-step-1` - `.uk-badge-step-5`, etc. These were all implemented as a darker/lighter shade of the primary colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2554","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2554/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2554/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2554/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2554","id":217351967,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTczNTE5Njc=","number":2554,"title":"Dropdown doesn't hide on outside click - iOS 8, 9,10 Safari","user":{"login":"metaine","id":5295208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5295208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine","html_url":"https://github.com/metaine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":544491574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDQ0OTE1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/labels/v2","name":"v2","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-27T19:36:33Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T14:57:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### UIkit version\r\n2.72.2\r\n\r\nHello!\r\n\r\nDropdowns' registerOuterClick subscribes to 'click.outer.dropdown' event, and seems that mobile Safari fires 'click' event only for elements styled as 'pointer:cursor' or that have a 'click' event handler. So if dropdown is opened, clicking outside of it on text or other non-interactive elements doesnt actually close it. \r\n\r\nYou can reproduce that even at your own page https://getuikit.com/v2/docs/dropdown.html. \r\nJust comment out the part \r\n$('article').on('click', '[href=\"#\"], [href=\"\"]', function (e) {\r\n       e.preventDefault();\r\n});\r\nwithin

I'm using Chrome on Linux.\r\n\r\nSee some of the suggestions here (re. adding `transform3d`, `backface-visibility: hidden` etc.):\r\n\r\n* https://scotch.io/tutorials/off-canvas-menus-with-css3-transitions-and-transforms\r\n* https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/off-canvas-navigation-for-responsive-website/\r\n\r\nHowever, re. `transform3d` specifically, see the following, which apparently caused issues for Jasny Bootstrap when they tried to accelerate their off-canvas menu:\r\n\r\n* http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2011/09/12/un-fixing-fixed-elements-with-css-transforms/\r\n* https://github.com/jasny/bootstrap/issues/186\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2197","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2197/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2197/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/issues/2197/events","html_url":"https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2197","id":199803229,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxOTk4MDMyMjk=","number":2197,"title":"Drag of Sortable item to end of group does not work until after dragging over other sort position","user":{"login":"lukehutch","id":811305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTMwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/811305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehutch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehutch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48863949,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODg2Mzk0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uikit/uikit/labels/JS","name":"JS","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-01-10T12:00:21Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T18:57:53Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"In the example for Sortable > Group:\r\n\r\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/sortable#group\r\n\r\nWhen dragging an item from one group to another, if you try to drag directly to the end of a group and drop the item in the final position, the drag is canceled.
